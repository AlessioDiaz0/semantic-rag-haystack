"Hi! I just wanted to make sure that it's okay to fill out the worksheets with an Apple Pencil/stylus, correct?"," Yes, according to the context provided, students are expected to complete the worksheets using any writing instrument of their choice, including an Apple Pencil or stylus.","Yes. You may complete it via the fillable PDF, using a tablet and pen, with your mouse, or print/fill/scan. ",1
Are we able to use private edStem posts to contact you or is email preferred?," The context states that personal matters or private concerns should be discussed directly with the Professor via email using your official @uci.edu email account. Therefore, it is preferred to use email for such communications rather than private EdDiscussion posts.","Yes, you can use private edStem posts or email to contact us. Also, there is a section in the syllabus describing how/where to contact us that you may find helpful.",2
"Is it possible for in person lectures to be recorded? A lot of students do agree that recorded lectures are helpful because we can go back whenever we're confused since the slides don't contain all the information said during lecture. I understand that if I'm having trouble, I should be attending office hours and discussions but the lectures have been the most helpful for me in the past. If I'm also not mistaken, I think the room is equipped to record lectures."," I'm not sure if recording lectures is permitted without authorization from the University and the course instructor, as stated in the syllabus. Students are encouraged to attend office hours and discussions instead. If there is a need for additional learning or assistance, students can use EdDiscussion or contact the instructor directly following the guidelines provided in the syllabus.","The slides are not meant to be a textbook of the material. They are supposed to be visual cues for the presentation. I do my best to include on the slides all of the main points and explanations of those main points (even if I don't plan to say them) so that you can use them for a reference to your learning later after the lecture. Also, the lecture is dynamic, so I expect that each time I discuss the topic, it will be presented slightly differently. Unless the lecture is scripted, the slides will never contain everything that I said or explained. 

I understand that many of you are used to lecture videos given the last 2 years of remote learning. But I do not believe that the live lecture recordings will provide educational benefit in this case (which is why I chose not to provide them). The recorded live lectures in the lecture hall only provide a recording of the projector screen and my voice. They do not include the laser pointer, my hand gestures/pointing, the full question from the audience, etc. Also, if something was confusing when I said it the first time, hearing me repeat it again the same exact way in the recording is not likely to help to clarify.


One of the main struggles I observed over the pandemic was that students lacked connections with the material. I believe this was due to watching the recordings alone and the lack of opportunities to discuss the material with other students, as well as to have the opportunity during your learning to ask a question and get an immediate answer. This is one of the reasons I am continually integrating active learning as much as possible into my courses. Active learning has become a key tool in teaching because it provides students with an immediate opportunity to engage with the concepts and reinforce their learning immediately. It creates opportunities to think things through, as well as discuss and reason together. Learning happens better through interactivity with the material and exposure to different viewpoints. This is also why in lectures I am constantly encouraging students to make friends and talk to their neighbors and to create study groups. The number of learning opportunities increases just by discussing the concepts before, during, and after the lecture (even if for a brief min or 2). My goal is to foster a learning community among everyone in the course - to use the lecture hall as a place to openly discuss the material together. 


Within my courses, I try to provide as many OH and opportunities for open questions and discussion with the course staff to promote engagement. It is much easier to guide and aid learning through conversation with you! This is why we provide the learning activities as a way to review and gauge your learning on the topics and then to seek out clarifications during the week to resolve any of your misunderstandings.

When the material is unclear in a lecture, I encourage you to ask questions (as many of the students do). I encourage you to listen to the questions of others and to use these as additional opportunities to think about the concept from a different viewpoint. If during the lecture, you have confusion, write it down to review/think/ask later. If after the lecture the material is still unclear, I suggest the following:

read the associated textbook sections

review/discuss the content with a peer

verify your understanding and check for misgivings using the learning activities

attend discussions/OH to ask clarifying questions and to discuss with the staff together. Or ask the questions on the discussion board - we do our best to respond to all posts in 12-24 hours. 

If you miss a lecture, that's ok! In this situation, I suggest the following:

Check with others in the course about what you missed or ask on EdD

Review the lecture slides to gauge the topics that were covered. Read through them to get a sense of what information is conveyed. 

Then, read the associated textbook chapters to have a solid presentation of the material. Section by section review the slides and note any questions you may still have. 

Bring questions to OH or discussion. Or ask the questions on the discussion board - we do our best to respond to all posts in 12-24 hours. 

Also, if you are struggling to follow in lecture, I suggest reviewing the slides prior to the week's lectures to get a sense of the topic or even read the chapters ahead of time to have a bit of foundation before the lectures. 

All of this being said, I know learning is hard and there will be bumps along the way. Remember that I don't expect students to master everything in the course perfectly. What I want is for you to engage with the course material and build your skillsets. I want to challenge my students to think beyond what is presented and to reason through the material - this is why an example is not given for every scenario. It was always my intention to provide the pre-recorded lectures from my remote offering as part of the review materials for the exams. These videos are short and cover 1 specific topic each. They present the material differently than it was delivered in the lecture providing a different explanation. Providing these as part of the midterm prep is an opportunity to review any missed concepts before the exam. It is my hope that these videos support your learning more than the live lecture recordings would.

"In the discord server for CS 122A people were making fun of a certain student in the class for her laugh and banter (the original message was deleted) and rather than talk to the student they decided to make a bunch of jokes pertaining to the student in the discord. I'm not sure if that student is in the discord server, but if they are then they most likely saw it and was possibly hurt by it. While people should be allowed to have opinions about other people, I don't think it is right to say it in a public server and indirectly make fun of people just because they didn't say the person's name. 

Here is some of what was said:

I'm sad because the server has been helpful to some students in understanding content better, but I don't think it should be a place where they make fun of a student rather than just talking to them directly. I figured you should know what was going on in the server since I'm not sure if this is going to happen again. If the person is in the server, then I would hate for them to experience this type of stuff again."," While the syllabus encourages students to use the EdDiscussion platform constructively to ask questions and learn from one another, it is important to remember that professional behavior is expected during all aspects of the course and between any course participant. Personal attacks, cyber-bullying, negativity or hurtful behavior is prohibited. If you observe any cases of non-professional behavior, including making fun of or hurting the feelings of another student, it is important to bring this to the attention of the staff member immediately. This behavior goes against UCI's commitment to ensuring equality and valuing diversity and creating an inclusive","It is unfortunate that the students in the course are acting in this manner. 

The discord is not an official part of the course. This is student-created and supported and therefore the staff has no control over what happens there. 

If you feel strongly about the situation, as it seems that you do, my best advice is to speak out on behalf of that person and support them. Counteract the negativity.  Consider reaching out personally or publically to the person to let them know you are on their side. Being an ally to the person can mean a lot and will encourage others to also speak up as an ally too.

"Hello professor Wong-Ma,

My name is Seongji Kim and my UCInetId is seongjk7.

I submitted the homework at 8:03:36 PM..



Will it be considered a late submission?"," According to the provided context, if an assignment is submitted within the 24 hours after the original homework deadline, it will be considered as using a late pass and cannot be reverted once used. In this case, since the submission time is within the 24 hours after the deadline, it is considered as using a late pass.
